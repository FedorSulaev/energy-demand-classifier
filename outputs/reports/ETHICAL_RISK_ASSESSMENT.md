# Ethical Risk Assessment – Electricity Demand Classification Model

**Project Description:**  
The model predicts electricity demand tiers (Low, Medium, High) using time-based and holiday features to improve operational efficiency, grid stability, and sustainability outcomes.

## Individual Discrimination
**Description:** Risk of unfair treatment of people due to biased data or model decisions.

- **Likelihood (1–5):** 2  
- **Severity (1–5):** 3  
- **Mitigation strategy:**  
  - The dataset does not include personal or demographic data, so direct discrimination risk is low.  
  - However, regional or temporal biases could indirectly disadvantage certain communities if predictions consistently misrepresent local consumption patterns.  
  - Mitigate by validating model performance across different regions and seasons.

## Privacy Violations
**Description:** Risk of misusing personal information or exposing sensitive data.

- **Likelihood (1–5):** 1  
- **Severity (1–5):** 2  
- **Mitigation strategy:**  
  - Data is fully aggregated and anonymized (hourly system-level consumption).  
  - No personal identifiers are used, so privacy risk is minimal.  
  - Maintain compliance with GDPR-style standards for data handling and storage.

## Economic Harm
**Description:** Risk of financial loss from wrong decisions based on model output.

- **Likelihood (1–5):** 3  
- **Severity (1–5):** 4  
- **Mitigation strategy:**  
  - Misclassification (e.g., underestimating High demand) could cause resource strain, inefficiencies, or cost spikes.  
  - Use ensemble averaging and confidence thresholds for critical operational decisions.  
  - Keep human oversight in forecasting and capacity planning loops.

## Social Inequality
**Description:** Risk of reinforcing existing unfairness or unequal access to energy.

- **Likelihood (1–5):** 3  
- **Severity (1–5):** 3  
- **Mitigation strategy:**  
  - Unequal regional data representation could bias model accuracy toward urban or industrial zones.  
  - Periodically audit model predictions for fairness across different geographic or socioeconomic segments.  
  - Use explainability tools (SHAP, LIME) to verify that model decisions remain grounded in legitimate operational factors.

---

## Loss of Autonomy
**Description:** Risk of removing human choice and control from decision-making processes.

- **Likelihood (1–5):** 2  
- **Severity (1–5):** 3  
- **Mitigation strategy:**  
  - Forecasts are advisory, not self-executing—operators maintain full control.  
  - Keep humans-in-the-loop for demand-response triggers and escalation paths.  
  - Clearly communicate model uncertainty and encourage contextual validation before decisions.

## Summary
| Risk Type | Likelihood | Severity | Overall Level | Mitigation Focus |
|------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Individual Discrimination | 2 | 3 | Low–Medium | Validate regional balance |
| Privacy Violations | 1 | 2 | Low | Maintain anonymization |
| Economic Harm | 3 | 4 | Medium–High | Keep human oversight |
| Social Inequality | 3 | 3 | Medium | Audit fairness, use SHAP/LIME |
| Loss of Autonomy | 2 | 3 | Low–Medium | Enforce human-in-the-loop |

**Conclusion:**  
Ethical risk levels are generally low to medium. The main challenge is ensuring **fairness and economic reliability**, not privacy or discrimination.  
Maintaining **human supervision, interpretability, and fairness auditing** will sustain trust and responsible use of the model.
