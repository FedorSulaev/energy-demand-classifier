# Stakeholder Impact Analysis – Electricity Demand Classification Model

**Use Case:** Predicting electricity demand tiers (Low, Medium, High) using time and holiday-based features to support operational decision-making and sustainability optimization.

---

## Direct Users
**Who uses the system directly?**  
Operators, analysts, and engineers in energy management or utility control centers.

- **Benefits:**
  - Gain data-driven insights for scheduling energy generation and storage.
  - Improve operational efficiency by anticipating demand fluctuations.
  - Reduce reliance on manual forecasting and reactive adjustments.

- **Risks:**
  - Overreliance on model predictions could lead to suboptimal allocation if predictions are off.
  - Misinterpretation of results (e.g., assuming model certainty) could distort planning.

- **Power to influence:** **High** – They can calibrate thresholds, adjust model usage, or override forecasts.  
- **Vulnerability:** **Medium** – Dependent on data quality and system interpretability for trustworthy use.

## Affected People
**Who is impacted by the decisions?**  
Consumers, industrial users, and energy producers indirectly influenced by demand-based adjustments.

- **Benefits:**
  - More stable grid performance and fewer outages.
  - Fairer pricing structures if demand forecasting leads to better load balancing.
  - Enhanced reliability during holidays or extreme conditions.

- **Risks:**
  - Inaccurate High/Low demand classifications could cause under- or over-supply, affecting prices or availability.
  - Potential for inequitable energy prioritization if certain regions or user groups are misrepresented in the data.

- **Power to influence:** **Low** – They rarely interact directly with forecasting systems.  
- **Vulnerability:** **High** – They experience downstream consequences of forecasting errors.

## Organizations
**What organizations are involved?**  
Utility companies, energy regulators, data analytics providers, and sustainability oversight bodies.

- **Benefits:**
  - Improve strategic planning and optimize infrastructure investments.
  - Enable data transparency for compliance with sustainability goals (e.g., SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy).
  - Foster collaboration between technical and policy teams through explainable models.

- **Risks:**
  - Model misuse or miscommunication of uncertainty can harm public trust.
  - Institutional inertia could delay corrective actions if model biases are found.

- **Power to influence:** **High** – They determine deployment, governance, and data access policies.  
- **Vulnerability:** **Low** – They have technical capacity to audit or adjust models.

## Society
**What are the broader social impacts?**  

- **Benefits:**
  - Supports energy sustainability and carbon reduction by improving efficiency.
  - Promotes fairness in energy distribution and access.
  - Contributes to data-driven policymaking and smart-grid innovation.

- **Risks:**
  - Automation bias could lead to overconfidence in AI-driven systems without adequate human oversight.
  - Data or model bias (e.g., seasonal underrepresentation) could perpetuate regional inequalities.

- **Power to influence:** **Medium** – Through policy advocacy and public accountability.  
- **Vulnerability:** **Medium** – Affected by long-term outcomes of infrastructure decisions.
