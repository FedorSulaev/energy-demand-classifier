## 📝 Data Preprocessing Checklist – Electricity Demand Dataset

### 1. Schema Validation
- Are all expected columns present? → ✅ Yes, `DateTime`, `Consumption`, and production sources are included.  
- Do column data types match what you planned? → ✅ Yes, `DateTime` is datetime, numeric features are int/float.  
- Are there any unexpected or unused columns? → ⚠️ Yes, `Consumption_log` and raw production columns are unused for modeling and were removed.  

---

### 2. Missingness Audit
- Are missing values within acceptable thresholds (e.g., <10%)? → ✅ Yes, no missing values detected.  
- Have you documented whether missingness is random or systematic? → ✅ Not applicable, dataset is complete.  
- Have imputation strategies been applied and noted? → ✅ Not needed, no missing data.  

---

### 3. Outlier Review
- Have you run outlier detection on all numeric features? → ✅ Yes, checked `Consumption`.  
- Are outliers flagged, capped, removed, or explained? → ✅ Capped at 0.05% / 99.95% quantiles → `Consumption_capped`.  
- Have extreme values been reviewed with domain context? → ✅ Yes, true peaks kept, implausible extremes capped.  

---

### 4. Class Balance Check
- Have you calculated and visualized class distribution? → ✅ Yes, demand tiers balanced by `pd.qcut`.  
- Do all classes meet a minimum threshold for samples (e.g., ≥50)? → ✅ Yes, each class has ~18,000 rows.  
- Have you documented any resampling decisions (SMOTE, undersampling)? → ⚠️ Not required, classes already balanced.  

---

### 5. Encoding Validation
- Are all categorical features encoded as planned? → ✅ Yes, `hour`, `day_of_week`, `month` encoded via sine/cosine.  
- Have you checked for category collapse (e.g., different labels encoded the same)? → ✅ No collapse, cyclical encoding creates unique pairs.  
- Do the dimensions of your encoded matrix match expectations? → ✅ Yes, 6 encoded features (2 per cycle).  

---

### 6. Scaling Verification
- Is scaling applied only to numeric features? → ⚠️ Not applied (cyclical features already in [-1, 1]).  
- Was the scaler fit only on the training set? → ⚠️ Not applicable.  
- Did you visualize feature distributions before and after scaling? → ⚠️ Not needed, distributions already bounded.  

---

### 7. Leakage Prevention
- Have you run a leakage detection check (e.g., future or label-derived features)? → ✅ Yes, checked; consumption values excluded from features.  
- Are any time-based features filtered correctly (no future info)? → ✅ Yes, only current hour/day/month encodings are used.  
- Are preprocessing steps cleanly separated by train/test? → ⚠️ Pipeline was fit on full dataset for stable tier cutoffs, justified as no leakage into features.  

---

### 8. Reproducibility
- Is your preprocessing script version-controlled (e.g., `src/preprocessing.py`)? → ⚠️ Not yet, currently in notebook.  
- Is there a `preprocessing_config.yml` or similar file with parameters? → ⚠️ Not yet, could be added for cutoffs and thresholds.  
- Have you saved your environment details (e.g., `requirements.txt`)? → ⚠️ Not yet, should be exported for reproducibility.
