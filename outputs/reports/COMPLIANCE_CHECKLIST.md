# Model Compliance Checklist – Electricity Demand Classification

☐ **Can we explain any decision to the affected person?**  
Yes. The model’s predictions can be explained using SHAP and LIME, providing clear feature-level insights.  
For example, if the model predicts “Medium demand,” we can show that this was driven by **time of day**, **holiday status**, and **weekday pattern**.  
Both local (single prediction) and global (overall behavior) explanations are available for transparency.

---

☐ **Have we tested for bias against protected groups?**  
Yes. The dataset contains **no personal or demographic data**, so direct bias is not applicable.  
Fairness testing focused on **temporal groups** (e.g., holidays vs non-holidays, weekdays vs weekends).  
No statistically significant bias was found across these segments.

---

☐ **Do we have human review processes for important decisions?**  
Yes. Human operators always **review and approve** forecasts before grid adjustments or production scheduling.  
Model outputs serve as **decision support**, not automation.  
Unexpected results (e.g., high demand during holidays) trigger human verification.

---

☐ **Can people appeal or challenge decisions?**  
Indirectly, yes. While individual consumers are not directly targeted by model outcomes,  
customers can **raise concerns through existing energy service feedback channels**.  
Operational forecasts affecting pricing or supply can be audited and revised by human analysts if needed.

---

☐ **Do we document our fairness testing and results?**  
Yes. All fairness testing (accuracy by class and time segment, SHAP-based feature analysis)  
is documented in **Notebook 07 – Feature Refinement and Assumption Testing** and **Notebook 08 – Explainability**.  
Results show stable model behavior across time-based categories, confirming consistent treatment.

### Summary
The model meets key transparency and accountability requirements.  
It is **explainable, audited, and human-supervised**, with documentation supporting responsible AI deployment.
